jobScraper
==========

Scraping tool that uses scrapy, pyquery and more
**What can it do?**
Well, it can currently execute a very large dataset of urls and automatically process them via command line. It will run a given set of urls, follow those, crawl each child page, and dump the results into json format.
So, give A-Z, you will get all job categories from A-Z, with all job listings, and all job listing details, as json -- a very large dataset indeed!

I'll probably add some d3 visualizations once I've fine tuned it all.
